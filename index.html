    <h1>Ali Bagheri</h1>
    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I am a computer engineer student at Babol Noshirvani institute of technology,
             who is interested in AI and Back-end development. I am currently working as a junior back-end developer.
             I am living in Arak but I am open to relocating for positions in Tehran.</p>
    <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am a hardworking man, whose challenges could never stop.
             I am a self-learner who wouldn't take a rest when it is hard to learn.
             I am a good team player who would help others in the team to reach our goals.
             When I start a project my only focus is on that and I would finish it way before the deadline.
             As a former computer olampyad participant, I am known for my different views on problems and the way I solve them.
             I try to be like a diamond when I am under pressure. I would adapt to hard situations to have my best performance.
             I am always interested to try new things and gain experience.
            </p>
