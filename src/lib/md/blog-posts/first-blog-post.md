# Why did I developed blog on my personal website?

So if you check my projects, you can see that there is a project called `Blog Forge`. Me and my coworker wanted to create a open-source blog project, and I would work on the back-end and he would work on the front-end and design. But due to lots and lots of reasons, we didn't get to working on it even after 6 months. I had lots of things to share with others, from challenges I deal with in my work, or even movies and series. So I decided to add blog to this project based on current design system to make it easier for me to develop. So here it is, so:

```bash
echo "Welcome to my blog!"
```
